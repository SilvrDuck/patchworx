# z3

An minimal s3 clone implemented in Zig.

## TODO

- [ ] Fix the redundancy between bazel and the native Zig build. Either find out how to properly use the Bazel rules for external dependencies, or implement custom rules to use the build.zig file instead (already had to do it for the proto generation).
